## The RaD-TM Methodology

While threat modeling is widely recognized as a critical step in building secure software, traditional approaches often attempt to model an entire application all at once. This requires a comprehensive understanding of the system from various teams, including engineering, operations, and security, which can produce overly broad findings that are difficult to refine and maintain at scale.

In modern software development, the shift-left movement emphasizes addressing potential issues early in the development lifecycle. Our Rapid Developer-driven Threat Modeling (RaD-TM) empowers software developers to incorporate threat modeling seamlessly into the development workflow. It enables them to generate threat models of individual pieces of functionality after the earliest design phase to identify and address security threats before development begins. This approach allows for quick turnarounds for security reviews and minimizes costly security rework later in the process.

Our vision is rooted in a systematic approach to building secure software containing four key stages: **Requirements**, **Design**, **Threat Modeling**, and **Development**. By integrating threat modeling during the design phase, teams are better equipped to anticipate potential risks and address them when changes are easiest and least costly to implement.

This methodology is versatile and designed to fit different contexts:

- **Individual Use:** Developers can model the threats for features they are working on individually.

- **Group Sessions:** Teams can collaboratively model potential threats for larger functionalities or an entire application.

A further limitation of traditional threat modeling is its reliance on the specialized expertise of security professionals. Most developers are not trained to systematically identify or prioritize threats, which makes traditional threat modeling methods challenging to implement without expert guidance. As these experts are scarce, it limits both the scalability of threat modeling and its adoption across large or fast-moving development organizations. The goal of this methodology is to empower developers to perform effective, lightweight threat modeling on individual features during the development workflow without requiring deep security expertise. The methodology is based on simplicity, speed, and repeatability.

Threat Templates introduce a novel approach to security standardization by eliminating the need for specialized security expertise. Rather than generating a massive threat model containing hundreds of items, our method focuses developers on identifying threats from a concise set of lists of up to 20 high-priority threats. These Threat Templates are pre-defined collections of threats and corresponding controls, each tailored to specific compliance standards, application environments, or organizational priorities. This streamlined structure guides developers—whether working individually or as part of a team to systematically identify and mitigate threats, making security a more accessible and efficient process.

The methodology makes **threat modeling accessible to all developers**, not just security experts. Its **lightweight nature** ensures it does not add significant overhead to the development workflow. Moreover, it supports **continuous refinement**, allowing threat models to evolve alongside the application's functionality, and ensures that security remains integrated throughout the development lifecycle.

By equipping developers with a structured, accessible approach to threat modeling, we enable organizations to deliver more secure software while reducing the time and effort spent on addressing security issues later in the development process. Below is a description of the six phases of our RaD-TM methodology, designed to be quick, easy, and seamlessly integrated into the development workflow. By breaking threat modeling into smaller, well-defined steps, any developer can identify and address security threats without undue overhead.

### Produce a Graphical Representation

Start by creating a clear graphical representation of the functionality. This step should take no more than ten minutes per individual feature and follows the requirements phase—where stakeholders identify, analyze, and document the necessary functionalities and constraints yet often overlook security considerations. Visualizing the application's structure at this stage helps bridge the gap left by requirements, specifically capturing potential security-relevant data flows, interactions, and dependencies that might otherwise go unaddressed.

**Steps**

1. **Identify the Feature:** Clearly define the feature or functionality being analyzed (e.g., "Transfer Funds Between Accounts").

2. **Map All Elements:**

    - Identify all components involved (e.g., user interface, APIs, databases, external services).

3. **Illustrate Interactions:**

    - Show how these elements interact, such as the flow of data between components:

        1. **Inputs:** What data does the feature consume? How does it enter the system?
        2. **Outputs:** What data does the feature produce? Where does it go?
        3. Specify the type of data exchanged at each interaction (e.g., user credentials, tokens, requests, responses).

**Deliverable**

A visual representation of the feature, showing its components, interactions, and data flows. This diagram sets the foundation for identifying security threats.

### Identify Trust Boundaries

Once the functionality is mapped out, focus on identifying **trust boundaries**: points where the level of trust changes within the system. Trust boundaries are critical for pinpointing potential attack surfaces.

**Steps**

1. **Locate Trust Boundaries:**

    - Identify points where data crosses between:

        - Different trust levels (e.g., user-to-server, internal-to-external systems).

        - Privilege levels (e.g., regular user-to-admin system interactions).

        - Ownership domains (e.g., your application and third-party APIs).

2. **Highlight Security-Relevant Transitions:**

    - Mark transitions where sensitive operations occur, such as authentication, encryption, or data storage.

**Deliverable**

A list of trust boundaries identified within the system. Each of them includes one or more nodes created in the previous step.

**Example**

- **User-to-System:** Input from the user into the application (e.g., login form submission).

- **System-to-Database:** Data exchanged between the application and its database.

- **Internal-to-External:** Interactions with third-party services or APIs.

- **Privilege Changes:** Where roles or permissions escalate (e.g., user-to-admin).

### Identify Threats Using Threat Templates

**Threat Templates** empower developers to conduct threat modeling independently, reducing reliance on security experts. These concise, pre-defined collections of (max) **20 threats** and corresponding controls are tailored to specific contexts, such as:

- **Compliance Standards** (e.g., FedRAMP, PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR).

- **Deployment Environments** (e.g., AWS, Azure, on-premises, etc).

- **Coding Guidelines** (e.g., secure code best practices, NIST CSF, OWASP recommendations).

- **Organizational Priorities** (e.g., vulnerability patterns or high-risk areas for the business).

Threat Templates streamline threat identification by focusing on relevant threats for a feature or system, ensuring no critical threats are missed. Their structured approach simplifies the process, enabling developers to work efficiently without requiring deep security knowledge.

For best results, **Threat Templates must be created and reviewed by a security expert**. Refer to the dedicated section on **Building Threat Templates** in this paper for detailed guidance on how to develop and maintain these templates effectively.

**Steps**

1. **Select a Threat Template Aligned to a Context** (reference the Appendix, for example, Threat Templates):

    - Compliance Context: (e.g., FedRAMP, PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR).

    - Deployment Context: (e.g., AWS, Azure, on-premises).

    - Implementation Context: (e.g., threats due to common code vulnerabilities).

    - Organizational Priorities: (e.g., threats identified from internal vulnerability management programs).

    Multiple threat templates can be selected depending on the audience working on the Threat Model. For example, in the context of a financial application within the scope for PCI DSS and deployed on AWS, developers can use the PCI DSS and Secure Code Implementation Templates while DevOps engineers can use the AWS Threat Template. Reference the full example for more information.

2. **Match Threats to the Feature:** Identify threats from the template that apply to the feature's components or workflows.

**Deliverable**

A list of threats relevant to the feature based on the selected Threat Template.

</tr>

</table>

### Identify Controls Using Threat Templates

For each threat identified, developers select corresponding **pre-approved** controls from the same Threat Template while having the flexibility to incorporate additional security measures as needed. These controls should align with:

- **Compliance Standards** (e.g., PCI DSS requirements, NIST 800-53).

- **Deployment-Specific Guidance** (e.g., AWS Well-Architected Framework).

- **Secure Coding Best Practices** (e.g., OWASP recommendations).

- **Internal Security Policies** (e.g., mandated libraries, APIs, or business processes).

**Steps**

1. **Identify Controls:** For each threat, list the controls provided in the Threat Template.

2. **Evaluate Implementation:**

    - Implemented: Control is operational and effective.

    - Partially or not implemented: Control exists but has gaps or is missing.

3. **Document Implementation Rationale:** Provide reasons for the control's implementation status.

**Deliverable**

A list of controls from the selected Threat Template, specifically designed to mitigate the risks posed by the identified threats.

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Back-end API</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Logging is operational, but real-time monitoring is not implemented.</td>
</tr>

</table>

### Rate and Prioritize Threats

For each identified threat, perform the following steps.

**Steps**

1. **Assess Severity:** Update the default severity rating of **High**, **Moderate**, or **Low** based on the likelihood of the threat occurring, its potential impact, and on the controls which have been already fully or partially implemented as documented in **Identify Controls Using Threat Templates**.

    **Note:** Each threat in a Threat Template typically comes with a default severity rating to streamline evaluation and prioritization.

2. **Determine Threat Status:**

    - **Mitigated:** The threat has been fully addressed through implemented controls.

    - **Accepted:** The threat is acknowledged and accepted because of low likelihood, minor impact, or a business decision.

    - **Open:** The threat remains unaddressed due to incomplete or missing controls.

3. **Provide Rationale:** Briefly explain why the threat is categorized as mitigated, accepted, or open. Propose actions or mitigations to address the remaining threats.

**Note:** Risk assessment considerations, including residual risk evaluation, are inherently tied to an organization's specific risk appetite and security posture. These aspects involve subjective judgments on impact and likelihood, which can vary significantly between organizations based on their controls and priorities. As such, they extend beyond the scope of this methodology, which focuses on a streamlined, developer-friendly approach to identifying and addressing threats. Instead of using risk ratings, we focus solely on severity ratings, simplifying the process while maintaining a practical approach to security. By avoiding complex risk assessments, we improve the chances of developer adoption, ensuring security is integrated efficiently without unnecessary overhead.

**Deliverable**

A report including all threats, severity ratings, and proposed mitigations.

Focus on high-severity unmitigated threats first and prioritise low-severity threats for later review.

### Document Results, Automate, and Iterate

**Summarize** the threat modeling outcomes in a concise, shareable report that includes:

- Feature description

- List of identified threats and linked controls

- Control implementation status and accepted threats

- Mitigation plans for any unaddressed issues

**Store** the threat model in the same ticket or feature record (e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps), ensuring easy access for the entire team and a clear audit trail proving security was addressed during development.

**Integrate** threat modeling into routine workflows (e.g., feature refinement or sprint planning). Leverage checklists, templates, or automated tools to generate or update models automatically, reducing manual overhead and fostering continuous security awareness.

## Building Threat Templates

Creating effective Threat Templates is best done by security experts, who curate a focused set of threats and corresponding controls tailored to specific compliance standards, application environments, or organizational needs.

Threat Templates serve as the core enabler of the RaD-TM methodology by allowing organizations to have their developers focus on a concise list—no more than 20 items—tailored to each new critical functionality. This developer-focused approach removes the need for extensive brainstorming and reduces complexity while ensuring that threats and controls remain aligned with compliance and context-specific priorities. By reusing pre-approved templates, organizations simplify and accelerate their threat modeling process, maintaining a balance between thoroughness and usability through a manageable list of (ideally) a maximum of 20 entries. As a result, threat modeling becomes both accessible to developers and robust in upholding high security and compliance standards.

This chapter provides a step-by-step guide for creating Threat Templates, using threats and controls relevant to PCI DSS as an example. Alternatively, threats can be derived from CIS Benchmarks or the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), with controls mapped from NIST SP 800-53.

Reference the Appendix for examples of Threat Templates.

### Define the Scope of the Threat Template

Clearly establish the scope and context for the Threat Template to determine which threats and controls are most relevant.

- **Compliance Context:** Is the template aimed at PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, or another standard?

- **Deployment Context:** Will the application run on AWS, Azure, on-premises, or embedded systems?

- **Industry Context:** Does the organization operate in banking, healthcare, automotive, or another vertical?

- **Implementation Context:** Which technologies and programming languages are being utilized?

- **Organizational Priorities:** What threats and vulnerabilities occur most often based on historical data?

For example:

- **Scope:** Banking application under PCI DSS compliance.

- **Focus:** Protecting sensitive payment data, preventing fraud, and ensuring secure authentication.

### Select Relevant Threats

Extract the most pertinent threats that align with the identified scope. For example, for a financial application subject to PCI DSS compliance, focus on threats outlined in the PCI DSS framework. Limit the total to a maximum of 20 entries, ensuring each threat aligns with the defined focus.

Map threats to specific, actionable controls. Organize the selected threats and mapped controls into a concise, developer-friendly format. Each threat should have one or more controls clearly listed for quick reference.

### Update and Maintain the Threat Template

Threat Templates should evolve over time:

- **Leverage Vulnerability Data:** Update templates based on recurring vulnerabilities identified in penetration tests or incident reports.

- **Monitor Emerging Threats:** Add new threats from industry reports or internal threat intelligence.

- **Incorporate Feedback:** Refine templates based on developer input and lessons learned during threat modeling.

## Full Example

Threat Modeling for "Transfer Funds Between Accounts" in a Banking Application.

### Produce a Graphical Representation

**Feature**

- **Functionality:** Allows users to transfer funds between their accounts.

**Inputs and Outputs**

- Inputs

    - User has already logged in

    - Source and destination account numbers

    - Transfer amount

- Outputs

    - Confirmation of the transaction

    - Error messages for invalid inputs or failed transfers

**Feature Use Case (High-Level)**

1. User logs in with valid credentials.

2. User navigates to "Transfer Funds."

3. User selects source account, destination account, and amount.

4. Application validates the input (checking sufficient funds, source and destination accounts, etc.).

5. Application processes the transfer, updates the database, and returns a confirmation message.

6. Application displays transaction confirmation and stores a record.

**Model Diagram**

![Model diagram](diagram.svg)

### Identify Trust Boundaries

**Public Network → DMZ VPC**

- **Entities:** A web browser (untrusted client) communicating with an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB).

- **Rationale:** The boundary between the public internet (anyone can connect) and the organization's first layer of infrastructure (the DMZ). The ALB terminates incoming HTTPS connections, providing a secured entry point.

**DMZ VPC → Private VPC**

- **Entities:** The Application Load Balancer forwarding requests to the Java Web App running on AWS ECS in the Private VPC.

- **Rationale:** Only traffic that passes ALB rules and security checks enters the Private VPC. This boundary ensures requests have been filtered (e.g., via security groups, ALB listeners) before reaching internal services.

**Private VPC → Database VPC**

- **Entities:**

    - Java Web App (ECS) and the Fund Transfer Service (AWS Lambda) in the Private VPC

    - AWS RDS MySQL database in the Database VPC

- **Rationale:** The database resides in a more restricted VPC, typically with tighter network and IAM constraints. Traffic crossing from the Private VPC to the Database VPC must satisfy additional security conditions (e.g., security group rules, IAM auth, or TLS connections). This boundary reflects heightened trust and data sensitivity.

### Document Results

#### Threat Template: PCI DSS

**Summary of Findings**

- The PCI DSS Threat Template applied to the "Transfer Funds" functionality **identified 18 threats**, of which:

    - 12 are mitigated.

    - 3 are partially mitigated.

    - 3 are unmitigated.

**Severity Report**

High Severity:

1. Inadequate Data Encryption (SQL Database)

    - Issue: RDS not encrypted.

    - Mitigation: Enable AWS KMS encryption; enforce with AWS Config.

2. Insufficient Incident Response (Global)

    - Issue: No formal incident response plan.

    - Mitigation: Develop/implement plan; conduct tabletop exercises.

Moderate Severity:

1. Inadequate Network Security (Application Load Balancer)

    - Issue: WAF planned, not deployed.

    - Mitigation: Deploy AWS WAF; configure baseline rules.

2. Weak Authentication Mechanisms (Java Web App)

    - Issue: MFA is live; password complexity pending.

    - Mitigation: Enforce strong password policies.

2. Default/Guessable Passwords (Java Web App)

    - Issue: MFA live; password rules pending.

    - Mitigation: Enforce password complexity.

3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Java Web App)

    - Issue: Partial CSP; no final DAST scan.

    - Mitigation: Complete CSP coverage; run DAST scans.

4. Unvalidated Redirects & Forwards (Java Web App)

    - Issue: No allow-list.

    - Mitigation: Validate redirect URLs or domains.

5. Denial of Service (DoS) (Application LB)

    - Issue: WAF not deployed.

    - Mitigation: Deploy AWS WAF or Shield; implement rate limiting.

6. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring (Java Web App)

    - Issue: SIEM not in production.

    - Mitigation: Deploy SIEM fully; monitor logs actively.

#### Threat Template: AWS

**Summary of Findings**

- The AWS Threat Template applied to the "Transfer Funds" functionality **identified 27 threats**, of which:

    - 16 are mitigated.

    - 6 are partially mitigated.

    - 5 are unmitigated.

**Severity Report**

High Severity:

1. IAM Policy Misconfiguration (Java Web App)

    - Issue: High-privilege policies remain.

    - Mitigation: Adopt least-privilege; remove wildcards.

2. Exposed AWS Access Keys (Java Web App)

    - Issue: Keys found in deprecated repo.

    - Mitigation: Rotate/revoke exposed keys; implement secret scans.

3. Unencrypted Data at Rest (SQL Database)

    - Issue: RDS not encrypted.

    - Mitigation: Enable encryption with AWS KMS.

4. CloudFormation Template Vulnerabilities (Java Web App)

    - Issue: Leftover credentials in templates.

    - Mitigation: Remove hard-coded secrets; consider CloudFormation Guard.

Moderate Severity:

1. EC2 Snapshot Exposures (Java Web App)

    - Issue: Manual snapshots; no auto-audits.

    - Mitigation: Automate snapshots; mark as private by default.

2. Route 53 DNS Misconfiguration (Global)

    - Issue: DNSSEC not enabled; no DNS change alerts.

    - Mitigation: Enable DNSSEC; set up CloudTrail alerts.

3. CloudFront Misconfiguration (ALB)

    - Issue: HTTPS enforced; WAF not deployed.

    - Mitigation: Deploy WAF; lock down origins with OAI.

4. AWS WAF Misconfiguration (ALB)

    - Issue: No custom rules or SIEM integration.

    - Mitigation: Deploy WAF in staging; tune rules; integrate logs.

5. KMS Key Policy Loopholes (Global)

    - Issue: Overly broad policies; rotation plan pending.

    - Mitigation: Remove wildcards; enable regular rotation.

6. AWS Secrets Manager Misconfiguration (Java Web App)

    - Issue: Not using Secrets Manager.

    - Mitigation: Migrate credentials to Secrets Manager; enforce rotation.

Low Severity:

1. Misconfigured Amazon EKS or ECS Clusters (Java Web App)

    - Issue: Partial network policies; no pod security policies.

    - Mitigation: Complete network/pod security policies; scan images regularly.
